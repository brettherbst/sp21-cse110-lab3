                        <p>Had to wake up early for discussion (lame). After that day went well- just chilled and watched some 
                            youtube videos. (Prob should've done this lab in all that time XD). Then I did some rush stuff for my
                            frat and ended the day on a good note :)

                        <p>Slept in on accident (classic me). But woke up in time to take care of some family buisness. After that, I then 
                            reviewed my group's meeting that I missed due earlier in the day (because of the fam stuff), and gave my feedback
                            and did everything I needed to do for the group. I then got some other school work done- but literally forgot about this
                            lab <b><strong>LMAO</strong></b>.

                        <p>Not that good. The fam stuff was rough and I felt bad about missing my first 110
                            meeting(even though they knew i couldn't make it and let them know well in adavnce, i stil
                            felt like a bad team memeber :( ). But you can't have good days with out bad ones!

                        <p>Oh lord. What a day. But I knew it was gonna be a lot. After waking up and making a quick breakfast, I hopped
                            in a meeting for my AIP class 12-2. Then I had a meeting for a eCamp I am help running. 2-5 (You see where this is going right?).
                            Then I had tutor horus 5-7:30 (27 tickets, was busy the whole time :) ). Then i had a frat meeting 8-9. Now I am panicking cause I forgot to
                            do this lab :)

                        <p>On Paper sounds bad right? Its not my favorite day, but I am enjoying it more than I thought tbh. It would be average I guess.
